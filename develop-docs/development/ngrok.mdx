# Using ngrok

The development server can be operated behind ngrok for when you need to receive traffic from the outside world. This comes up frequently when working with integrations. 

## Ngrok in `monolith` mode

The following are the steps will setup ngrok for integrations in `monolith` mode:

### Step 1: Create Ngrok Config File
Start off by defining a configuration file forÂ `ngrok`:

```yaml
version: '2'
authtoken: <YOUR-NGROK-AUTHTOKEN>
tunnels:
  acme-org:
    proto: http
    hostname: <yourdomain>.ngrok.io
    addr: 8000
    host_header: "rewrite"
```

You can grab your auth token from https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken

### Step 2: Start Ngrok
Next start up ngrok with your configuration file:
```shell
ngrok start --all --config ngrok.yml
```

### Step 3: Start Devserver
It is recommended to use `getsentry` while working with integrations. When starting the devserver, use the `--ngrok` flag:
```shell
getsentry devserver --ngrok=<yourname>.ngrok.io
```
